ortak lets coding agents and people work in the same live directory without separate branches or worktrees. It records each edit and creates task branches when the work ends.

## How it works

1. Everyone edits the same workspace and uses the same running system.
2. ortak records each edit with its session, file, and changed lines.
3. The gate prevents sessions from editing the same active region. Reported errors stop edits until the assigned session fixes them.
4. `ortak publish` creates a clean branch from one session's recorded changes.

## Install

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

Initialize ortak inside your project and start the daemon:

```bash
cd /path/to/your-project
ortak init
ortak daemon
```

For Claude Code, install the plugin from this repository:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add /path/to/ortak
claude plugin install ortak@ortak
```

## Use

```bash
ortak status
ortak log
ortak intent ortak-2 "Implement the login page"
ortak report ortak-2 --command "pytest" "relevant error output"
ortak resolved ortak-2
ortak publish ortak-2 --push
```

Publishing requires a Git repository with at least one commit and a configured remote.
